WPC Variation Duplicator helps you duplicate a variation with all properties in just 1-click.

== Description ==

When you have plenty of similar variations to create, this plugin will come to rescue by offering the 1-click duplication of variations. Don’t miss out on this wonderful free plugin; it will save you more time and effort than you might think.

In the Variations tab, users can click on the “Duplicate” button and all the properties of that variation (including image, SKU, price, stock, height/weight, description, shipping/tax class, and so on) will be copied to the newly created one. Literally everything will be duplicated into the new variation. It’s easier now since users only have to modify just some details to mark the discrepancies between variations now.

What’s best about **WPC Variation Duplicator for WooCommerce** is that it is compatible with other WPClever plugins that deal with different aspects of variations in variable products, namely variation selectors (Show Single Variations, Radio Buttons, Variation Swatches, Variation Tables, etc.), variation additional images, variation-level product timers/countdown timers, variation-level quantity rules, etc. Not just product properties, the special variation-based settings can be copied to the duplicated variation easily.

= Key Features =

- One click to duplicate all properties of a variation into the new one
- Indicate the ID of the original variation for management
- Copy the images, SKU, stock, price, description, shipping/tax class, height/weight
- Compatible with most common WordPress themes and WooCommerce add-ons
- Compatible with all WPClever plugins

After being duplicated, the newly created variation(s) will be kept right under their original variation(s) so you can effortlessly track the duplicated ones that need to be edited. Besides, there will be a brief notice to let you know from which variation each one is duplicated.

In the plugin settings, users can also specify how many copies to be made by pressing the “Duplicate” button. By default, when duplicating, there will be just 1 copy of the original variation to be created. Users can specify based on their actual needs to complete their job faster.
